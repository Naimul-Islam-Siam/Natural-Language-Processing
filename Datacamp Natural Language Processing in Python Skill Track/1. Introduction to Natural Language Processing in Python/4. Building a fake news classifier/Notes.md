- Commonly used for testing nlp classification problems
- Given a particular piece of data, you likely is a particular outcome
- Not always the best tool for a job, but simple and effective enough for a simple classification

## Improving the model
- Tweaking alpha levels
- Trying a new classification model
- Training on a larger dataset
- Improving text preprocessing
